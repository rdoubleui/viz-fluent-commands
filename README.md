# viz-fluent-commands
Small node module for building tcp commands for VizRT's scripting interface in Viz Engine fluently (experimental). 

##Considerations

Based on the [wiki article][] the approach for *fluent interfaces* in JavaScript could be to use *prototype inheritance*. In general an object method returns a reference to itself to allow for cascaded method calls.

Next step: Start using a test framework.
